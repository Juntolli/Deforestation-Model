# Deforestation-Model

A Google Colab file simulating a 2D cellular automaton model of deforestation and its impact on forest collapse.

The goal is to identify if, and where, a tipping point occursâ€”a moment when deforestation leads to a self-sustaining collapse of the forest due to the loss of connectivity between forested cells.
